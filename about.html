<!-- about Content -->
<h2 class="section-heading">About Me</h2>
<p>I am a third year of electrical engineering at the University of British Columbia. I am currently searching of another internship after this school semester.</p>

<p>
This page was created with Jekyll, Github pages, Ruby, and Bootstrap. It is version 2.0 of an older blog I used to have, and which I hope you haven't seen. *cringes* That one was not so good-looking, served off of Heroku, and didn't really have proper blog logic implemented. I'd like to give a short thanks to Jekyll for being so awesome. Downloading it on Windows was a bit hairy, but other than that, fantastic.
